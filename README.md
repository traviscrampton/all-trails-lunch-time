# AllTrails Lunch Application

A small app that hits the google maps and places api in order to search for different restaurant options that are in the near area.

# To get started:

Run yarn install
This will not work unless the .env files are in place. I can send over the correct text for the env file.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### jest

This will run the whole script of tests

# Final Note

If there are any questions or if there is any trouble getting the application to load I am happy to field any questions that arise.
